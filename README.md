## Project Overview

+ My goal is to share daily insights and solutions as I tackle the intriguing problems presented by Advent of Code.
+ This project serves as a platform for continuous learning, allowing me to evolve from a novice programmer to a coding ninja ðŸ¥·.
+ I will use diagrams to visualize and better understand the problems.

## Programming Language: Python

A crucial decision for this project is the selection of the programming language.
I've chosen to dive into the world of Python, because its versatility opens doors to a myriad of applications, ranging from web development to data analysis and artificial intelligence.

## What to Expect

I'm looking forward to facing the challenges and sharing my journey with other developers.
I may not be able to do both parts of a given day or days. The important thing is that I am committed to learning and improving my programming skills.
If you have suggestions, improvements or corrections, feel free to open an issue or send a pull request. ðŸ˜Œ
